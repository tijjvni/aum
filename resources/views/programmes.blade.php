          <p>Biotechnology is a compound word derived from two words: Biology and technology. As a programme of study,
            Biotechnology is the science of modifying organisms t improve their functions, usability and benefits for
            society.</p>
          <p> As a technology that is based on biology, it combines biological disciplines like genetics, molecular
            biology,
            biochemistry, embryology and cell biology with technical disciplines like chemical engineering, information
            technology, and robotics.</p>
          <p>A biotechnologist must be well versed in genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology,
            microbiology,
            plant sciences, physiology, immunology, toxicology, and pharmacology. As a student, you will need to
            understand
            the principles of biological systems, and the interactions between them.</p>
          <p>Increasingly, biotechnology is also being applied to problems in the environment and energy. Genetically
            engineered micro-organisms and plants clean up toxic wastes from industrial production and oil spills. Genetic
            methods are used to identify particular populations of endangered species.</p>
          <p> The B.Sc Biotechnology programme at Al-Ansar University enables students to acquire both theoretical and
            practical knowledge and skills in the field of biotechnology and bioengineering, and acquire skills in the
            design of equipment, processes, product development and enhancement.</p>

          <h1 class="font-medium text-lg uppercase underline">Career opportunities
          </h1>
          <p> Biotechnology has a significant role in every sector of scientific research, making it inevitable that the
            number of jobs on offer will be increasingly high in the future.
            It is an interesting and dynamically evolving area that continues to create ever-new job opportunities. As a
            graduate of Biotechnology, you can explore suitable opportunities in any of these areas among others.</p>
